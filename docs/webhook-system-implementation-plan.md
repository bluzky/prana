---

## Phase 1: Core Webhook Infrastructure (High Priority)

### Task 1: Webhook Utilities Module

**Objective**: Create webhook utility functions and data structures (no centralized registry)

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **webhook-1**: Create `Prana.Webhook` utilities module (no centralized state)
- [ ] **webhook-2**: Implement webhook URL pattern parsing and building functions
- [ ] **webhook-3**: Add webhook validation and data creation helpers

#### Technical Details
- Pure functions for webhook ID generation and URL building
- URL patterns: `/webhook/workflow/trigger/:workflow_id` and `/webhook/workflow/resume/:resume_id`
- Utilities for webhook validation and data structure creation
- No centralized state - applications handle persistence

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.1**: Parse webhook URLs correctly for trigger (`/webhook/workflow/trigger/:workflow_id`) and resume (`/webhook/workflow/resume/:resume_id`) patterns
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.2**: Generate unique resume webhook IDs following pattern `webhook_{execution_id}_{node_id}_{random}`
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.3**: Route incoming webhooks to appropriate handlers with state validation
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.4**: Handle invalid webhook URLs and invalid states with clear error messages
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.5**: Support configurable base URL for full webhook URL generation
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.6**: Implement webhook lifecycle states (pending, active, consumed, expired)
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.7**: Generate resume URLs at execution start for expression availability

### Task 2: Webhook Data Structures and Context

**Objective**: Define core data structures and execution context enhancements

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **webhook-4**: Create Prana.WebhookRegistration struct with all required fields
- [ ] **webhook-5**: Add resume_urls map to ExecutionContext for node-specific expression access
- [ ] **webhook-6**: Implement workflow scanning and resume URL generation at execution start

#### Technical Details
- WebhookRegistration with resume_id, execution_id, node_id, status, timestamps
- ExecutionContext enhanced with `resume_urls: %{"node_id" => "webhook_url"}` map
- Workflow scanning to identify wait nodes and pre-generate their resume URLs
- Expression support for `$execution.{node_id}.resume_url` syntax

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.8**: WebhookRegistration contains all required fields (resume_id, execution_id, node_id, status, created_at, expires_at, webhook_config)
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.9**: ExecutionContext.resume_urls contains map of node_id â†’ webhook_url for all wait nodes
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.10**: Workflow scanning correctly identifies all wait nodes at execution start
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.11**: Expression engine supports `$execution.{node_id}.resume_url` syntax
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.12**: Resume URLs generated with pattern `webhook_{execution_id}_{node_id}_{random}`
- [ ] **AC-WH-1.13**: All webhook structs have proper type specifications and validation

## Phase 2: Integration (Medium Priority)

### Task 7: Webhook Wait Action

**Objective**: Add webhook waiting capability to Wait integration

#### Implementation Tasks
- [x] **webhook-7**: Add webhook wait action to Prana.Integrations.Wait

#### Technical Details
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Implemented `wait_webhook/1` function with webhook activation logic
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Webhook timeout handling with configurable `timeout_hours` parameter
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Proper suspension data generation for GraphExecutor
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Unified wait action with three modes: interval, schedule, webhook
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test coverage with 25 test scenarios

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **AC-WH-2.1**: `wait_webhook/1` activates pre-existing webhook registration and returns suspension data
- [x] **AC-WH-2.2**: Activated webhooks transition from pending to active state with proper expiry
- [x] **AC-WH-2.3**: Support configurable webhook timeout with default of 24 hours
- [x] **AC-WH-2.4**: Return suspension data with complete webhook registration for application persistence
- [x] **AC-WH-2.5**: Validate execution context contains resume_url and current node_id
- [x] **AC-WH-2.6**: Handle webhook activation failures gracefully with clear error messages

### Task 8: GraphExecutor Webhook Integration

**Objective**: Integrate webhook suspensions with GraphExecutor execution results

#### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **webhook-8**: Return webhook data in GraphExecutor execution results (not middleware)
- [ ] **webhook-9**: Handle webhook suspension return tuples in GraphExecutor
- [ ] **webhook-10**: Integrate webhook resume with existing `resume_workflow/4` API

#### Technical Details
- Handle `{:suspend, :webhook, registration_data}` returns in GraphExecutor
- Return webhook data directly in execution results for application storage
- Integrate with existing `resume_workflow/4` API for webhook resume
- No middleware events - webhook data flows through normal execution results

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC-WH-3.1**: GraphExecutor returns webhook data in execution results when suspended
- [ ] **AC-WH-3.2**: Webhook suspension tuples handled correctly in execution flow
- [ ] **AC-WH-3.3**: Webhook resume integrates seamlessly with existing `resume_workflow/4` API
- [ ] **AC-WH-3.4**: Applications receive complete webhook data for persistence and routing
- [ ] **AC-WH-3.5**: No centralized state in Prana - all persistence handled by applications

## Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Medium-Low Priority)
