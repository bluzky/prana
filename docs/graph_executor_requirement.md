# Prana GraphExecutor - Requirements Document

**Version**: 1.2
**Date**: June 23, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete with Sequential Execution, Phase 2-4 Planned

## 1. Overview

The **GraphExecutor** is the core workflow orchestration engine in the Prana automation platform. It executes pre-compiled workflow graphs by coordinating node execution, managing data flow between nodes, and handling workflow lifecycle events.

### 1.1 Purpose

- **Workflow Orchestration**: Execute workflows based on dependency graphs with sequential node coordination
- **Data Flow Management**: Route data between nodes through explicit port-based connections
- **Sub-workflow Support**: Handle nested workflow execution in multiple modes (sync, async, fire-and-forget)
- **Event Integration**: Emit lifecycle events for application integration via middleware
- **Error Handling**: Provide comprehensive error management and graceful failure handling

### 1.2 Key Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: GraphExecutor handles orchestration; NodeExecutor handles individual nodes
- **Port-based Architecture**: Explicit data routing through named input/output ports
- **Dependency-driven Execution**: Nodes execute when their dependencies are satisfied
- **Sequential Execution**: Independent nodes execute sequentially for predictable behavior
- **Context Management**: Shared execution state for expression evaluation and data access

## 2. Phase 1 Requirements (âœ… COMPLETE)

### 2.1 Scope: Core Execution (Sync/Fire-and-Forget Only)

**Focus**: Basic workflow orchestration with sequential execution, without async suspension/resume complexity

### 2.2 Primary API

```elixir
execute_graph(execution_graph, input_data, context \\ %{})
  :: {:ok, Execution.t()} | {:error, reason}

# Required context structure
context = %{
  workflow_loader: (workflow_id -> {:ok, ExecutionGraph.t()} | {:error, reason}),
  variables: %{},     # optional
  metadata: %{}       # optional
}
```

### 2.3 Core Functionality Implemented

#### 2.3.1 Graph Execution Orchestration
- âœ… Accept pre-compiled `ExecutionGraph` from `WorkflowCompiler`
- âœ… Execute nodes based on dependency order from ExecutionGraph
- âœ… Track execution progress in `Execution` struct
- âœ… Coordinate sequential execution of independent nodes
- âœ… Detect workflow completion (no more ready nodes)

#### 2.3.2 Sequential Node Execution
- âœ… Execute ready nodes sequentially using `execute_nodes_sequentially/4`
- âœ… Process nodes one-by-one in batch order for predictable execution
- âœ… Fail-fast behavior: stop execution on first node failure
- âœ… Maintain execution order within each batch of ready nodes

#### 2.3.3 Port-based Data Routing
- âœ… Route output from completed nodes to dependent nodes based on `output_port`
- âœ… Use `ExecutionGraph.workflow.connections` to determine data flow paths
- âœ… Prepare input for target nodes using `ExpressionEngine.process_map/2`
- âœ… Handle failed nodes (nodes with `output_port = nil`) - no data routing

#### 2.3.4 Context Management
- âœ… Maintain shared execution context across workflow execution
- âœ… Store node results under node `custom_id` for expression access (`$nodes.node_id.output`)
- âœ… Update context as nodes complete with their output data
- âœ… Support flexible context structure with input, variables, metadata, and nodes

#### 2.3.5 Node Execution Integration
- âœ… Use `NodeExecutor.execute_node/3` for individual node execution
- âœ… Wrap node execution with `execute_single_node_with_events/3` for middleware events
- âœ… Handle node execution results and update execution state
- âœ… Track node executions in `Execution.node_executions`
- âœ… Convert simple map contexts to ExecutionContext structs for NodeExecutor

#### 2.3.6 Sub-workflow Support (Sync & Fire-and-Forget)
```elixir
# Sync mode: Execute sub-workflow and wait for completion
{:ok, child_result} = execute_sub_workflow_sync(child_graph, input_data, context)
# Merge child_result into parent context, continue execution

# Fire-and-forget mode: Trigger sub-workflow and continue immediately
:ok = execute_sub_workflow_fire_and_forget(child_graph, input_data, context)
# Parent continues without waiting
```

#### 2.3.7 Sub-workflow Loading via Callback
- âœ… Use `context.workflow_loader` callback to load sub-workflow ExecutionGraphs
- âœ… Handle loading errors gracefully
- âœ… Support application caching/precompilation strategies

#### 2.3.8 Middleware Event Emission
```elixir
# Emit lifecycle events during execution
Middleware.call(:execution_started, %{execution: execution})
Middleware.call(:node_started, %{node: node, node_execution: node_execution})
Middleware.call(:node_completed, %{node: node, node_execution: node_execution})
Middleware.call(:node_failed, %{node: node, node_execution: node_execution})
Middleware.call(:execution_completed, %{execution: execution})
Middleware.call(:execution_failed, %{execution: execution, reason: reason})
```

#### 2.3.9 Error Handling
- âœ… Workflow-level error management and propagation
- âœ… Sequential execution error handling with fail-fast behavior
- âœ… Sub-workflow loading error handling
- âœ… Node execution error handling (delegated to NodeExecutor)
- âœ… Graceful workflow termination on critical errors
- âœ… Structured error responses with execution state

### 2.4 Integration Points

- âœ… **Input**: `ExecutionGraph` from `WorkflowCompiler.compile/2`
- âœ… **Node Execution**: `NodeExecutor.execute_node/3`
- âœ… **Expression Evaluation**: `ExpressionEngine.process_map/2` (via NodeExecutor)
- âœ… **Events**: `Middleware.call/2` for lifecycle events
- âœ… **Sub-workflow Loading**: `context.workflow_loader.(workflow_id)`

### 2.5 Key Internal Functions Implemented

```elixir
# Main execution orchestration
execute_graph(execution_graph, input_data, context) :: {:ok, Execution.t()} | {:error, reason}

# Graph traversal and coordination
find_ready_nodes(execution_graph, completed_nodes, context) :: [Node.t()]
execute_nodes_batch(ready_nodes, execution_graph, context) :: {:ok, [NodeExecution.t()]} | {:error, reason}
execute_nodes_sequentially(nodes, execution_graph, context, completed) :: {:ok, [NodeExecution.t()]} | {:error, reason}

# Single node execution with events
execute_single_node_with_events(node, execution_graph, context) :: NodeExecution.t()

# Data routing between nodes
route_node_output(node_execution, execution_graph, context) :: map()
route_batch_outputs(node_executions, execution_graph, context) :: map()

# Sub-workflow execution modes
execute_sub_workflow_sync(node, context) :: {:ok, context} | {:error, reason}
execute_sub_workflow_fire_and_forget(node, context) :: {:ok, context} | {:error, reason}

# Execution state management
update_execution_progress(execution, completed_nodes) :: Execution.t()
workflow_complete?(execution, execution_graph) :: boolean()
```

### 2.6 Sequential Execution Behavior

#### 2.6.1 Linear Execution Patterns
- **Pattern 1.1 (Sequential Chain)**: A â†’ B â†’ C â†’ D
  - âœ… Natural sequential execution due to dependencies
  - Each node waits for previous to complete
  
- **Pattern 1.2 (Linear Branching)**: A â†’ (B, C, D)
  - âœ… **NEW**: B, C, D execute sequentially (not parallel)
  - Predictable execution order within batch
  - Fail-fast: if B fails, C and D don't execute

#### 2.6.2 Error Handling in Sequential Execution
```elixir
# When node fails during sequential execution
{:error, %{
  type: "node_execution_failed",
  message: "Node #{node_id} failed during sequential execution",
  node_id: failed_node_id,
  node_executions: [completed_nodes..., failed_node],
  error_data: node_error_details
}}
```

### 2.7 Phase 1 Success Criteria Met

2. âœ… Handle sequential node execution correctly
3. âœ… Route data between nodes via ports properly
4. âœ… Execute sync sub-workflows with result merging

## 3. Phase 2 Requirements (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)

### 3.1 Scope: Async Execution with Suspension/Resume

**Focus**: Advanced sub-workflow execution with workflow suspension capabilities

### 3.2 Core Functionality

#### 3.2.1 Async Sub-workflow Execution
```elixir
# Async mode: Execute sub-workflow with suspension/resume
{:suspended, resume_token} = execute_sub_workflow_async(child_graph, input_data, context)
# Parent workflow suspends, returns control to application
# Later: resume_workflow(resume_token, sub_workflow_result)
```

#### 3.2.2 Workflow Suspension/Resume Mechanisms
- **Suspension Points**: When async sub-workflows are triggered
- **Resume Tokens**: Unique identifiers for suspended executions
- **State Persistence**: Save execution state via middleware events
- **Resume Logic**: Restore execution state and continue from suspension point

#### 3.2.3 Advanced Sub-workflow Support
- **Multiple Async Sub-workflows**: Coordinate multiple concurrent sub-workflows
- **Nested Async Execution**: Support async sub-workflows within async sub-workflows
- **Result Aggregation**: Merge multiple sub-workflow results into parent context
- **Timeout Handling**: Handle sub-workflow timeouts and cleanup

#### 3.2.4 Enhanced Context Management
- **Suspension State**: Track suspended nodes and their dependencies
- **Resume Context**: Restore execution context from persisted state
- **Sub-workflow Coordination**: Manage parent-child execution relationships

### 3.2.5 Application Integration

- **Resume API**: Application-triggered workflow resumption
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor suspended and active executions

## 4. Phase 3 Requirements (ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)

### 4.1 Scope: Retry and Timeout Mechanisms

**Focus**: Resilience and reliability features for production workflows

### 4.2 Core Functionality

#### 4.2.1 Node-level Retry Policies
```elixir

  max_attempts: 3,
  backoff_strategy: :exponential,
  base_delay_ms: 1000,
  max_delay_ms: 30000,
  retry_on: [:network_error, :timeout]
}
```

#### 4.2.2 Retry Coordination
- **GraphExecutor-NodeExecutor Integration**: Coordinate retry attempts
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent delay between retry attempts
- **Retry State Tracking**: Monitor retry counts and failures
- **Selective Retry**: Retry only on specific error types

#### 4.2.3 Timeout Management
- **Node-level Timeouts**: Individual node execution timeouts
- **Workflow-level Timeouts**: Overall workflow execution limits
- **Sub-workflow Timeouts**: Timeout handling for nested workflows
- **Graceful Timeout**: Clean resource cleanup on timeout

#### 4.2.4 Circuit Breaker Patterns
- **Failure Thresholds**: Automatic circuit opening on repeated failures
- **Recovery Detection**: Automatic circuit closing when service recovers
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative execution paths when circuits are open

#### 4.2.5 Advanced Error Handling
- **Error Classification**: Categorize errors for appropriate handling
- **Error Aggregation**: Collect and analyze error patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue execution with reduced functionality
