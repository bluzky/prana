# GraphExecutor - Execution Patterns & Plans

**Version**: 3.0
**Date**: June 23, 2025
**Purpose**: Document all possible workflow execution patterns supported by GraphExecutor with conditional branching

## Core Design Principles

### Conditional Execution Architecture
- **Path-Based Routing**: Only nodes on active conditional paths execute
- **Active Path Tracking**: Context tracks which conditional branches are active
- **Exclusive Branch Execution**: IF/ELSE and Switch patterns ensure only one path executes
- **Context-Aware Completion**: Workflows complete when no more ready nodes exist (not all possible nodes)

### Execution Context Tracking
- **Executed Nodes**: Context includes `executed_nodes: ["A", "if_condition", "B3"]` for downstream access
- **Active Paths**: Context tracks `active_paths: %{"node_id_port" => true}` for conditional filtering
- **Path Awareness**: Nodes can determine execution path through context inspection
- **Dynamic Completion**: Workflow completion based on active execution paths, not total node count

## 1. Linear Execution Patterns

### 1.1 Straight Sequential (Chain)
**Pattern**: A → B → C → D
**Description**: Simple sequential execution where each node depends on the previous one.

```
[Start] → [Node A] → [Node B] → [Node C] → [End]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Data processing pipelines
- Step-by-step user onboarding
- Sequential API calls with dependencies

**Execution Characteristics**:
- ✅ Single execution path
- ✅ No parallelism
- ✅ Clear dependency chain
- ✅ Easy to debug and monitor

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Supported**

---

### 1.2 Linear with Branching (Fork)
**Pattern**: A → (B, C, D) where B, C, D execute sequentially
**Description**: One node triggers multiple branches that execute in sequence, not parallel.

```
[Start] → [Node A] → [Node B] → (completes)
                  → [Node C] → (completes)
                  → [Node D] → (completes)
```

**Execution Requirements**:
- **Sequential Execution**: Branches execute one after another, not simultaneously
- **All Must Complete**: Workflow completes when ALL branches finish
- **Fail-option**: single fail could fail whole workflow or continue execution
- **Data Distribution**: Each branch receives copy of Node A's output
- **Predictable Order**: Execution order maintained within ready node batch

**Use Cases**:
- Sequential notifications to multiple channels
- Ordered data validation checks
- Sequential API calls with same input
- Predictable processing pipelines

**Execution Characteristics**:
- ✅ Sequential execution after trigger
- ✅ Predictable execution order
- ✅ Independent branch processing
- ✅ Automatic completion detection
- ✅ Fail-fast error handling

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Supported**

## 2. Conditional Execution Patterns

### 2.1 Simple Condition (If-Then-Else)
**Pattern**: A → Condition → B or C → (different or same paths)
**Description**: Conditional routing where each clause may lead to different output paths or converge to same path.

```
# Scenario 1: Different output paths
[Start] → [Node A] → [Condition] ┌─ [Node B] → [End B] (leaf)
                                 └─ [Node C] → [End C] (leaf)

# Scenario 2: Convergent paths
[Start] → [Node A] → [Condition] ┌─ [Node B] ─┐
                                 └─ [Node C] ─┘ → [Node D] → [End]
```

**Execution Requirements**:
- **Single Path Execution**: Only one branch (B OR C) executes based on condition
- **Context Tracking**: Update `executed_nodes` to include path taken
- **Flexible Convergence**: Branches may lead to different endpoints or same endpoint
- **User Responsibility**: Downstream nodes must handle different data structures if paths converge

**Context Access Pattern**:
```elixir
# Node D can check execution path (if paths converge)
if "B" in $context.executed_nodes do
  # Handle B branch data
else if "C" in $context.executed_nodes do
  # Handle C branch data
end
```

**Use Cases**:
- User role-based workflows with different endpoints
- Error handling with separate or convergent paths
- Feature flag routing

**Execution Characteristics**:
- ✅ Single path execution
- ✅ Dynamic routing based on condition evaluation
- ✅ Prevents both branches from executing
- ✅ Context tracking of executed path
- ✅ Flexible path destinations
- ✅ Efficient resource usage

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Supported**


---

### 2.2 Multi-branch Condition (Switch)
**Pattern**: A → Switch → B or C or D or E (to various endpoints)
**Description**: Multiple conditional paths based on switch node output, with flexible endpoint routing.

```
[Start] → [Node A] → [Switch] ┌─ [Node B] (case 1) → [End 1]
                              ├─ [Node C] (case 2) → [End 2]
                              ├─ [Node D] (case 3) → [Merge] → [End 3]
                              └─ [Node E] (default) → [End 4]
```

**Execution Requirements**:
- **Exclusive Execution**: Only ONE branch executes based on switch evaluation
- **Flexible Routing**: Each case can lead to different processing and endpoints
- **Default Handling**: Fallback path when no conditions match
- **Context Tracking**: Record which case was executed

**Use Cases**:
- Payment method routing
- Multi-tenant workflows with different endpoints
- Status-based processing with various outcomes
- Complex workflow routing based on data values

**Execution Characteristics**:
- ✅ Multiple possible paths
- ✅ Exclusive execution (only one case executes)
- ✅ Named port routing (premium, standard, basic, default)
- ✅ Flexible endpoint routing
- ✅ Default fallback handling
- ✅ Scalable branching
- ✅ Context tracking of executed case

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Fully Supported**

## 3. Convergent Execution Patterns

### 3.1 Diamond Pattern (Fork-Join)
**Pattern**: A → (B, C) → Merge → D
**Description**: Sequential branching followed by data merging (not waiting - that's handled by Wait-for-All pattern).

```
[Start] → [Node A] → ┌─ [Node B] ─┐
                     └─ [Node C] ─┘ → [Merge] → [Node D] → [End]
```

**Execution Requirements**:
- **Sequential Execution**: B and C execute sequentially, not in parallel
- **Merge Node Responsibility**: Merge node only handles data combination from completed branches
- **No Waiting Logic**: This pattern does not handle async waiting (see Wait-for-All Parallel pattern)
- **Fail-Fast Behavior**: If ANY branch (B or C) fails, entire pattern fails immediately

**Merge Node Configuration**:
```elixir
%Prana.Node{
  type: :action,
  integration_name: "core",
  action_name: "merge",
  settings: %{
    "strategy" => "combine_arrays"     # Data combination only
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Data aggregation from multiple sequential sources
- Sequential processing with result consolidation
- Data transformation pipelines with merge step

**Execution Characteristics**:
- ✅ Sequential processing
- ✅ Clear data merging
- ✅ Separation of concerns (merge vs wait)
- ✅ Simple execution model

## 4. Async Coordination Patterns

### 4.1 Wait-for-All Parallel (Async Synchronization)
**Pattern**: source → (F, F1) → Wait → doSomething
**Description**: Explicit synchronization point for async operations.

```
[Source] → ┌─ [F] (async) ─┐
           └─ [F1] (async) ─┘ → [Wait] → [doSomething] → [End]
```

**Execution Requirements**:
- **Async Branch Support**: F and F1 can trigger sub-workflows or long-running operations
- **Explicit Synchronization**: Wait node acts as coordination point
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeout for async operations (future implementation)
- **All Branch Completion**: Wait for ALL async branches before proceeding

**Wait Node Configuration**:
```elixir
%Prana.Node{
  type: :wait,
  integration_name: "core",
  action_name: "wait_for_completion",
  settings: %{
    "timeout_ms" => 30000,
    "wait_strategy" => "all_branches",
    "on_timeout" => "fail"
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:

### 5.2 Loop Over Items Pattern (n8n-style)
**Pattern**: A → LoopOverItems → (loop: B → C → back, done: D)
**Description**: Iterate over collection items with explicit loop/done outputs and automatic termination.

```
[Data Source] → [Loop Over Items] ┌─ loop → [Node A] → [Node B] ─┐
                     │            │                              │
                     │            └──────────── back ←──────────┘
                     │

**Description**: Workflow suspends execution and waits for external events (webhooks, human approvals, manual triggers).

```
[Start] → [Node A] → [Wait for Event] ──(suspended)──→ [Database Storage]
                           │
                           └── (external event) ──→ [Resume] → [Node B] → [End]

```
[Start] → [Node A] → [Poll API] ──(condition false)──→ [Wait] ──→ [Poll API]
                          │                               │        │
                          └──(condition true)──→ [Node B] → [End]  │
                                                                    │
                                                   (loop back) ←────┘
