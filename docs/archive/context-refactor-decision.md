# Context Refactor Decision Document

**Date**: January 3, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Version**: 2.0

## Background

The current Prana codebase has multiple context structures that create complexity, duplication, and conversion overhead:

- **Execution** - Top-level workflow execution tracking
- **ExecutionContext** - Structured context for NodeExecutor (atom keys)  
- **OrchestrationContext** - Private map in GraphExecutor (string keys)
- **ExpressionContext** - Format for ExpressionEngine ($ prefixed keys)
- **NodeExecution** - Individual node execution state

These multiple contexts require constant conversion and synchronization, leading to performance overhead and maintenance complexity.

## Decision

### **Unified Execution Structure with Runtime State**

Refactor to a single, authoritative execution context that eliminates ExecutionContext and consolidates all context management:

```elixir
%Prana.Execution{
  # Persistent metadata (for database storage)
  id: String.t(),
  workflow_id: String.t(), 
  status: :running | :completed | :failed | :suspended,
  vars: map(),  # workflow variables (renamed from input_data)
  node_executions: [NodeExecution.t()],  # execution audit trail
  
  # Suspension state
  suspended_node_id: String.t() | nil,
  suspension_data: map(),
  preparation_data: map(),
  
  # Runtime state (ephemeral, rebuilt on load)
  __runtime: %{
    "nodes" => %{node_id => output_data},     # completed node outputs for routing
    "env" => map(),                           # environment data from application
    "active_paths" => %{path_key => true},    # conditional branching state
    "executed_nodes" => [String.t()]          # execution order tracking
  } | nil  # nil when loaded from storage
}
```

### **Simplified API Interface**

**GraphExecutor:**
```elixir
execute_graph(execution_graph, init_context)
# Where init_context = %{vars: map(), env: map(), metadata: map()}

resume_workflow(execution, resume_data, env_data, execution_graph)
# Where execution is loaded by application, env_data provides environment context
```

**NodeExecutor:**
```elixir
execute_node(node, execution, routed_input)  # Direct execution access with pre-routed input
resume_node(node, execution, suspended_node_execution, resume_data)  # Resume suspended nodes
```

### **Standardized Expression Context**

NodeExecutor builds unified expression context with required built-in variables:

```elixir
%{
  "$id" => node.id,                    # current node ID
  "$input" => routed_input_by_port,    # input data by port: %{"primary" => data1, "secondary" => data2}
  "$nodes" => execution.__runtime["nodes"], # completed node outputs
  "$env" => execution.__runtime["env"],     # environment variables
  "$vars" => execution.vars,               # workflow variables
  "$workflow" => %{id: ..., name: ...},    # workflow metadata
  "$execution" => %{id: ..., mode: ..., pre: ...} # execution metadata
}
```

### **Two-Mode Input Handling**

**Mode 1: Structured Input (input_map defined)**
```elixir
%Prana.Node{
  input_map: %{
    "url" => "$vars.api_base/users/$input.primary.user_id",
    "method" => "GET", 
    "headers" => %{"Authorization" => "Bearer $env.token"},
    "user_data" => "$input.primary",
    "config" => "$input.secondary.config"
  }
}

# Action receives evaluated input_map:
# %{"url" => "https://api.com/users/123", "method" => "GET", "headers" => %{...}, ...}
```

**Mode 2: Raw Input (input_map nil)**
```elixir
%Prana.Node{
  integration_name: "code",
  action_name: "eval", 
  input_map: nil  # No input transformation
}

# Action receives raw routed_input:
# %{"primary" => %{user_id: 123, ...}, "secondary" => %{config: %{...}}}
```

## Key Benefits

### **1. Eliminates Context Duplication**
- Remove ExecutionContext struct entirely
- Single source of truth for all execution state
- No more context conversion overhead

### **2. Perfect State Rebuilding**
All runtime state is derivable from persistent data:
- `active_paths` from `node_executions.output_port`
- `nodes` from `node_executions.output_data`
- `executed_nodes` from `node_executions` order

### **3. Clean API Separation**
- **Persistent**: audit trail, suspension state, workflow variables
- **Runtime**: performance optimizations, environment data, routing state

### **4. Performance Maintained**
- O(1) node output access during execution
- String keys for expression engine compatibility
- No conversion overhead between contexts

### **5. Predictable Action Interface**
- Actions with `input_map` receive structured, known data formats
- Actions without `input_map` handle raw input for maximum flexibility
- Multi-port access through expression system (`$input.primary`, `$input.secondary`)
- Clear separation between input routing and action execution

## Analyzed Concerns & Resolutions

### **✅ Memory Usage**
**Concern**: Duplication of node output data in both `node_executions` and `__runtime.nodes`

**Resolution**: 
- Current architecture already has this duplication
- Performance benefit justifies memory cost
- Typical impact: <100KB for normal workflows, ~2MB for very large ones
- Acceptable trade-off for O(1) routing performance

### **✅ State Rebuilding Complexity**
**Concern**: Runtime state might be complex to rebuild from storage

**Resolution**:
- `active_paths` rebuilds trivially from `output_port` in node executions
- `nodes` rebuilds from `output_data` in node executions
- Only external dependency is environment data (provided by application)
- Rebuilding is O(n log n) and only happens on resume/recovery

### **✅ Performance Impact**
**Concern**: Rebuilding could be expensive for large workflows

**Resolution**:
- Rebuilding only happens on resume/recovery, not during normal execution
- <1ms for typical workflows, <100ms for very large ones
- Net performance improvement by eliminating repeated context conversions
- Background/lazy rebuilding available if needed

### **✅ State Synchronization**
**Concern**: Risk of `node_executions` and `__runtime` getting out of sync

**Resolution**:
- Use encapsulated update functions (`Execution.complete_node/4`, `Execution.fail_node/3`)
- Never allow direct modification of execution fields
- Atomic updates ensure both persistent and runtime state stay synchronized

### **✅ Null Runtime Handling**
**Concern**: Need careful null checks when `__runtime` is nil

**Resolution**:
- Required initialization step: `prepare_execution_for_use/2` before execution
- Clear API contract: loaded executions need runtime rebuilding
- Lazy rebuilding on first access as fallback option

### **✅ Expression Context Input**
**Concern**: How `$input` gets routed node input in new architecture

**Resolution**:
- GraphExecutor pre-routes input using existing connection logic
- Pass routed input explicitly to NodeExecutor: `execute_node(node, execution, routed_input)`
- Clear separation: GraphExecutor handles routing, NodeExecutor handles execution

### **✅ Multiple Input Ports and Action Data Access**
**Concern**: How actions access data from multiple input ports and handle input_map configuration

**Resolution**:
- **Two-mode input handling**: Actions with `input_map` get structured, predictable data; actions without `input_map` get raw routed data
- **Mode 1 (input_map defined)**: Evaluate input_map expressions and pass result to action - ensures predictable data structure
- **Mode 2 (input_map nil)**: Pass raw routed_input directly to action - for code/dynamic actions that handle arbitrary data
- **Multi-port access**: Actions can specify `"$input.primary"`, `"$input.secondary"` in input_map to access specific ports
- **Flexible sourcing**: Mix input ports with configuration (`"$input.primary.user_id"`, `"$vars.api_url"`, `"$env.token"`)

### **✅ Suspension/Resume Integration**
**Concern**: How `resume_node` fits into the new unified execution architecture

**Resolution**:
- Update `resume_node` signature: `resume_node(node, execution, suspended_node_execution, resume_data)`
- Remove ExecutionContext dependency from resume flow
- Application loads execution, GraphExecutor ensures runtime state via `prepare_execution_for_use/2`
- Consistent pattern: both execute and resume use unified execution structure

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Add Runtime Infrastructure** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Add `__runtime` field to Execution struct
- ✅ Implement `rebuild_runtime/2` function
- ✅ Add encapsulated update functions (`complete_node/4`, `fail_node/3`)
