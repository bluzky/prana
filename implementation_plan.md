## Key Changes from Original Plan

### âœ… Completed Simplifications
- **Removed Storage Adapters**: Replaced with middleware for application control
- **Removed Hook System**: Middleware provides better composability
- **Simplified Integration Registry**: No complex validation/normalization
- **Struct-Based Design**: Type safety with compile-time checking
- **Single Integration Registration**: Only module-based, no map definitions

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus Areas for Phase 2
- **Node Executor**: Action invocation with expression-based input preparation
- **Graph Executor**: Workflow traversal and parallel execution coordination
- **Middleware Integration**: Emit lifecycle events during execution
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and recovery

### ðŸ“‹ Deferred to Applications
- **Persistence**: Applications handle via middleware
- **External Coordination**: Applications manage via middleware
- **Health Monitoring**: Basic registry health + application middleware
- **Configuration Management**: Simple config + application-specific logic

This revised plan reflects the cleaner, more focused design we've developed, with clear separation between library responsibilities (execution) and application responsibilities (persistence, coordination).
