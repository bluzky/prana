# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Prana** is an Elixir workflow automation platform built around a node-based graph execution model. It orchestrates workflows consisting of nodes (triggers, actions, logic, wait, output) connected through explicit ports with conditional routing and template-based data flow.

**Current Status**: **Production-Ready Core Platform** (~95% complete)
- âœ… Complete execution engine with conditional branching and sub-workflow support
- âœ… Comprehensive built-in integrations (Manual, Logic, Data, Workflow, Wait, HTTP, Code)
- âœ… Advanced features: Loop constructs, template engine integration, and performance optimizations
- ðŸŽ¯ Current branch: `feature/for-each-loop` - Adding enhanced loop processing capabilities

## Key Commands

### Development

- **25 test files** with comprehensive coverage for core execution engine
- **Test coverage priorities**: HTTP integration (55-80%), Code integration (34-85%)
- Test files follow `*_test.exs` naming convention
- Use `mix test --trace` for detailed test output
- Use `mix test --cover` to generate coverage reports

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Type Safety**: All data uses proper Elixir structs with compile-time checking
- **Behavior-Driven**: Clean contracts for integrations and middleware
- **Node-Port Model**: Explicit data flow through named ports between nodes
- **Template Integration**: Dynamic data access and templating using MAU library
- **Action Behavior Pattern**: Actions implemented as modules following Prana.Behaviour.Action with prepare/execute/resume methods

### Key Components

#### Core Data Structures (`lib/prana/core/`)
- **`Prana.Workflow`**: Complete workflow with nodes and double-indexed connections
- **`Prana.Node`**: Individual workflow node with type, integration, action, and configuration
- **`Prana.Connection`**: Port-based connections between nodes with conditions and data mapping
- **`Prana.WorkflowExecution`**: Complete execution instance with runtime state and audit trail
- **`Prana.NodeExecution`**: Individual node execution state tracking

**Serialization Support**: All core structs implement `from_map/1` and `to_map/1` for JSON-compatible persistence with automatic type conversion and nested struct handling.

```elixir
# Serialize workflow to JSON-compatible map
workflow_map = Prana.Workflow.to_map(workflow)
json_string = Jason.encode!(workflow_map)

# Restore from JSON with proper types
workflow_data = Jason.decode!(json_string)
restored_workflow = Prana.Workflow.from_map(workflow_data)
```

#### Optimized Connection Structure
```elixir
%Workflow{
  connections: %{
    "node_key" => %{
      "output_port" => [%Connection{...}, ...],
      "error_port" => [%Connection{...}, ...]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Execution Engine
- **`Prana.NodeExecutor`** (`node_executor.ex`): âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Executes individual nodes with template-based input preparation, Action behavior execution, suspension/resume patterns, and comprehensive error handling
- **`Prana.GraphExecutor`** (`execution/graph_executor.ex`): âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - Orchestrates workflow execution using NodeExecutor, handles conditional branging, port-based routing, sub-workflow coordination, and middleware integration
- **`Prana.Template`** (`template.ex`): âœ… **COMPLETE** - Template processing using MAU library for dynamic data access

#### Registry & Extension System
- **`Prana.IntegrationRegistry`** (`registry/integration_registry.ex`): GenServer managing integrations and their actions
- **`Prana.Behaviour.Integration`**: Contract for workflow integrations
- **`Prana.Behaviour.Middleware`**: Contract for workflow lifecycle event handling

#### Built-in Integrations (`lib/prana/integrations/`)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Manual`** (`manual.ex`): Test actions for development and testing workflows (100% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Logic`** (`logic.ex`): Conditional branching with IF/ELSE and switch/case routing (100% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Data`** (`data.ex`): Data merging and combination operations for fork-join patterns (100% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Workflow`** (`workflow.ex`): Sub-workflow orchestration with suspension/resume coordination (100% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Wait`** (`wait.ex`): Delay actions and timeout handling for time-based workflows (96% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.HTTP`** (`http.ex`): HTTP requests, webhooks, and API interactions (55-80% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Code`** (`code.ex`): Secure Elixir code execution with sandboxing (34-85% coverage)
- **`Prana.Integrations.Schedule`** (`schedule.ex`): Cron-based scheduling and time triggers (100% coverage)

#### Node Retry System âœ… **NEW**
- **`Prana.NodeSettings`** (`core/node_settings.ex`): Per-node retry configuration with delay and attempt limits
- **Suspension-based retry**: Failed nodes return `{:suspend, :retry, suspension_data}` for application scheduling
- **Smart retry logic**: Distinguishes between execution failures (retryable) and resume failures (not retryable)
- **Full integration**: Works with existing suspension/resume infrastructure and middleware events

#### Middleware System
- **`Prana.Middleware`** (`middleware.ex`): Pipeline execution engine for lifecycle events
- Events: `:execution_started`, `:execution_completed`, `:execution_failed`, `:node_starting`, `:node_completed`, `:node_failed`, `:node_suspended`, `:execution_suspended`

### Template System Integration

The platform uses MAU library for template processing and dynamic data access:
```elixir
# Template expressions are processed by MAU library
# Refer to MAU documentation for syntax and capabilities
# Context includes: input, nodes, variables, and execution state
```

### Conditional Execution Patterns

The Graph Executor now supports advanced conditional branching:

#### IF/ELSE Branching
```elixir
# Only one branch executes based on condition
A â†’ Condition â†’ (B OR C) â†’ different or convergent paths
```

#### Switch/Case Routing
```elixir
# Named port routing with exclusive execution
A â†’ Switch â†’ (premium OR standard OR basic OR default)
```

#### Active Path Tracking
- Context tracks `active_paths` to prevent both branches from executing
- Context includes `executed_nodes` for path-aware processing downstream
- Workflows complete when no ready nodes exist (not all possible nodes)

- **Development Tools**: Visual workflow builder, validation utilities, testing frameworks
- **Advanced Patterns**: Complex coordination patterns, parallel execution optimizations
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Plugin system for third-party integrations

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Struct-Only Data** - No dynamic maps, all typed structs for compile-time safety
2. **Module-Based Integrations** - Only support behavior-implementing modules, no map definitions
3. **Middleware for Application Logic** - Clean separation between library (execution) and application (persistence)
4. **Port-Based Routing** - Explicit named ports for data flow instead of implicit connections
5. **Third-Party Template Engine** - Uses MAU library instead of built-in expression system
6. **Failed Executions Design** - Failed nodes have `output_port = nil`, error routing handled at graph level
7. **Simplified Behaviors** - Removed storage adapters, hook system; middleware provides better composability
8. **No Complex Validation** - Trust integration structs, simplified registry without normalization

### Working with the Codebase

- **Middleware**: Event handling, pipeline execution, error resilience
- **Performance testing**: Use `benchee` for execution engine benchmarking
- Use `mix test --trace` for detailed test output during development
- Focus on improving coverage for HTTP and Code integrations
- MAU library handles all template processing - no need for expression engine tests

#### Node Retry Configuration
```elixir
# Create a node with retry settings
node_with_retry = %Prana.Node{
  key: "http_request",
  type: "http.request",
  params: %{url: "https://api.example.com/data"},
  settings: %Prana.NodeSettings{
    retry_on_failed: true,
    max_retries: 3,
    retry_delay_ms: 5000  # 5 second delay between retries
  }
}

# Application handles retry suspensions like other suspensions
case Prana.GraphExecutor.execute_workflow(execution, input) do
  {:suspend, suspended_execution, %{"resumed_at" => resumed_at}} ->
    # Schedule retry using timestamp instead of delay
    delay_ms = DateTime.diff(resumed_at, DateTime.utc_now(), :millisecond) |> max(0)
    Process.send_after(self(), {:resume_execution, suspended_execution}, delay_ms)
    
  {:suspend, suspended_execution, other_data} ->
    # Handle other suspension types normally
    handle_other_suspension(suspended_execution, other_data)
end
```

#### Integration Development
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SlackIntegration do
  @behaviour Prana.Behaviour.Integration

  def definition do
    %Prana.Integration{
      name: "slack",
      display_name: "Slack",
      actions: %{
        "send_message" => %Prana.Action{
          name: "send_message",
          module: __MODULE__,
          function: :send_message,
          input_ports: ["input"],
          output_ports: ["success", "error"]
        }
      }
    }
  end

  def send_message(input) do
    {:ok, %{message_id: "123"}}
  end
end
```

#### Middleware Development
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.DatabaseMiddleware do
  @behaviour Prana.Behaviour.Middleware

  def call(event, data, next) do
    # Handle event (e.g., persist to database)
    result = next.(data)
    # Post-process if needed
    result
  end

- use mix run -e "code" to run custom code or short snipped
- use mix test test_file_path.exs --trace for verbose output log, there is no -v option
- you have to setup IntegrationRegistry before test. So add this to setup ` {:ok, registry_pid} = IntegrationRegistry.start_link()`
and remember to terminate process on exit
 on_exit(fn ->
        if Process.alive?(registry_pid) do
          GenServer.stop(registry_pid)
        end
      end)

- Using `tree` command to check directory structure
